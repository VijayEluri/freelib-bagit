	<dcterms:description>Different views of the pattern of social evolution among the highly eusocial
		bees have arisen as a result of discordance between past molecular and morphology-based
		phylogenies. Here we present new data and taxa for four molecular data sets and reassess the
		morphological characters available to date. We show that there is no significant character
		incongruence between four molecular data sets (two nuclear and two mitochondrial) but that there
		is highly significant character incongruence, which leads to topological incongruence, between
		the molecular and morphological data. We investigate the effects of using different outgroup
		combinations to root the estimated tree. We also consider various ways in which biases in the
		sequence data could be misleading, employing several maximum likelihood models, LogDet
		corrections, and spectral analyses. Ultimately, we concede that there is strong discordance
		between the molecular and morphological data partitions, and that the conditional combination
		approach is appropriately applied in this case. We also find for the molecular trees that there
		are two equally well supported placements of the root, one supported by 16S and 28S sequences,
		the other supported by cyt b and opsin. The strength of the evidence leads us to accept two
		equally well supported hypotheses based on analyses of the molecular data sets. These are the
		most rigorously supported hypotheses of corbiculate bee relationships at this time, and frame
		our argument that highly eusocial behavior within the corbiculate bees evolved twice
		independently.</dcterms:description>
